\item SSL requires use of esp8266/\+Arduino 2.\+4.\+0, which is not yet released (platform = espressif8266\+\_\+stage in Platform\+IO).
\item SSL requires the build flag -\/DASYNC\+\_\+\+TCP\+\_\+\+SSL\+\_\+\+ENABLED=1
\item SSL only supports fingerprints for server validation.
\item If you do not specify one or more acceptable server fingerprints, the SSL connection will be vulnerable to man-\/in-\/the-\/middle attacks.
\item Some server certificate signature algorithms do not work. SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, and MD5 are working. SHA384, and SHA512 will cause a crash.
